## Emergency Help

### Device Won't Boot

Symptoms: device stuck on boot logo, loops endlessly, or only boots to recovery/fastboot.

#### Immediate Quick Fixes (try first)

1. Disable Magisk modules (Magisk installed)
   - Try holding Volume Up during early boot to trigger module safe mode (works on many devices/Magisk builds).
   - If you can access recovery/adb:
     - ADB in recovery: `adb shell magisk --remove-modules`
     - Or delete module folders: `adb shell rm -rf /data/adb/modules/*` then reboot.

2. Boot to recovery/bootloader
   - Power + Volume combo varies:
     - Pixel: Power + Volume Down ‚Üí select Recovery
     - Samsung: Power + Volume Up (+ Bixby on older models) while USB connected
     - Most others: Power + Volume Up (recovery), Power + Volume Down (bootloader)
   - Detailed instructions: [Custom Recovery Installation](./android-root-guides/how-to-install-custom-recovery.md)

3. Wipe Dalvik/ART cache
   - Custom recovery: Wipe ‚Üí Advanced wipe ‚Üí Dalvik/ART cache + Cache.
   - Stock recovery: If available, ‚ÄúWipe cache partition.‚Äù (Some devices removed this option.)

4. Undo the last change
   - Remove the last module/kernel/ROM you flashed.
   - Restore the last NANDroid backup if available.

#### Advanced Recovery Steps

1. Restore a full backup (custom recovery)
   - TWRP/OrangeFox ‚Üí Restore ‚Üí System + Boot + Data ‚Üí Reboot.

2. Flash the correct stock image for your partition scheme
   - For devices shipping with Android 13+ (e.g., Pixel 7/8/9, some Samsung/OnePlus/Xiaomi GKI2):
     - Patch/flash init_boot.img (not boot.img).
   - For older devices:
     - Patch/flash boot.img.
   - Commands (A/B example):
     ```bash
     # Bootloader/fastboot mode
     fastboot devices
     # Flash patched image to both slots if needed
     fastboot flash init_boot_a magisk_patched.img
     fastboot flash init_boot_b magisk_patched.img
     fastboot reboot
     ```
   - If returning to stock:
     ```bash
     fastboot flash init_boot stock_init_boot.img   # or boot.img for older devices
     fastboot reboot
     ```

3. Flash full stock firmware
   - Pixel: Use Android Flash Tool (web) or factory image scripts.
   - Samsung: Odin with full firmware (AP/BL/CP/CSC). Use HOME_CSC to preserve data (if possible). KNOX remains tripped once bootloader is unlocked.
   - Xiaomi/POCO/Redmi: Mi Flash Tool with fastboot ROM (mind Anti-Rollback).
   - OnePlus: MSMDownloadTool/OP Local Update or fastboot packages (availability varies by model/region).
   - Device-specific guides: [Pixel](./android-root-guides/how-to-root-pixel-phone.md) ‚Ä¢ [Samsung](./android-root-guides/how-to-root-samsung-phone.md) ‚Ä¢ [Xiaomi](./android-root-guides/how-to-root-xiaomi-phone.md) ‚Ä¢ [OnePlus](./android-root-guides/how-to-root-oneplus-phone.md)

4. Factory reset (last resort)
   - Stock recovery: Wipe data/factory reset.
   - Fastboot: `fastboot -w` then `fastboot reboot`.
   - Warning: erases all user data.

#### üì± Emergency Commands Reference

```bash
# Reboot to different modes
adb reboot bootloader
adb reboot recovery
fastboot reboot fastboot   # userspace fastboot (fastbootd) for dynamic partitions

# Boot a recovery image without flashing
fastboot boot recovery.img

# Disable all Magisk modules (from recovery/adb)
adb shell magisk --remove-modules

# Flash original images (choose boot or init_boot as appropriate)
fastboot flash boot stock_boot.img
fastboot flash init_boot stock_init_boot.img

# Switch active slot (A/B devices)
fastboot getvar current-slot
fastboot set-active a    # or b

# Full wipe (last resort)
fastboot -w
```

Pro tips:
- Always keep a copy of stock boot/init_boot images and your last patched image.
- On A/B devices, prefer Magisk‚Äôs ‚ÄúInstall to Inactive Slot (After OTA)‚Äù to keep OTA survival.
- Don‚Äôt mix images from different builds. Build fingerprint must match.

---

### Root Not Working

Symptoms: apps report ‚Äúno root,‚Äù superuser prompts don‚Äôt appear, or the manager shows N/A.

#### Basic Verification

- Root manager status
  - Magisk: App opens, shows App and Magisk versions. ‚ÄúInstalled‚Äù should display. If N/A, installation failed.
  - KernelSU: App shows kernel supported/enabled. If unsupported, flash a KSU-enabled kernel.
- Check with a simple root app (e.g., Termux + `su`, or a reputable root checker).
- Confirm you didn‚Äôt restore an OTA without re-installing root to the current slot.

#### Fixes by Method

Magisk:
1. Reinstall app and re-install to current slot
   - Install latest Magisk APK (from official GitHub).
   - Open ‚Üí Install ‚Üí Direct Install (or ‚ÄúInstall to Inactive Slot (After OTA)‚Äù if applicable).
   - Reboot.
2. Ensure correct target image
   - Android 13+ devices often require patching init_boot.img (not boot.img).
   - Extract from your exact firmware build (use payload-dumper-go for payload.bin, or extract AP tar on Samsung).
3. Zygisk and DenyList
   - Settings ‚Üí Enable Zygisk (if you need module/hide features that depend on it).
   - Configure DenyList for apps that mustn‚Äôt see root.
   - Reboot after changes.
4. Module conflicts
   - Disable all modules (see Emergency) and re-enable one by one.

KernelSU:
- Confirm your kernel has KSU integrated for your exact build.
- Use the official KernelSU Manager.
- If switching kernels, match your ROM/firmware version and vendor partition.

APatch:
- Ensure device/kernel is supported (ARM64 only, specific kernel ranges).
- Follow the project‚Äôs official documentation for your exact device/ROM.

#### Clean Re-install (Magisk)

Method A: Patch and flash
```bash
# 1) Extract the correct image from your current firmware (boot.img or init_boot.img)
# 2) Patch with Magisk (on-device)
# 3) Flash with fastboot to both slots if A/B
fastboot flash init_boot_a magisk_patched.img
fastboot flash init_boot_b magisk_patched.img
fastboot reboot
```

Method B: Recovery flash (legacy devices with custom recovery)
- Boot to TWRP/OrangeFox.
- Flash the Magisk ZIP/APK (if supported).
- Reboot; install Magisk app if needed.

---

### Play Integrity and Banking Apps

Many apps now use Google Play Integrity (replacing SafetyNet). There are multiple levels:
- BASIC: Device appears unmodified at a basic level.
- DEVICE: Device passes device-level integrity.
- STRONG: Hardware-backed. Typically fails on unlocked bootloaders.

Important:
- We don‚Äôt provide instructions to bypass security requirements of protected apps. This section focuses on legitimate compatibility best practices.

Best practices to improve compatibility:
- Keep firmware and Play Services up to date.
- Use Magisk‚Äôs DenyList to limit root visibility to sensitive apps.
- Avoid granting root to unnecessary apps.
- Clear data for Google Play Store and Play Services after major changes; reboot:
  - Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Google Play Services ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Clear cache/data.
  - Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Google Play Store ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Clear cache/data.
  - Reboot; check Play Store ‚ÄúDevice is certified.‚Äù
- Some apps will not run on unlocked bootloaders regardless of configuration (they require STRONG integrity). Consider:
  - A secondary unmodified device for critical apps.
  - Work profile separation (e.g., Shelter) without attempting to circumvent security.

Testing tools:
- Play Integrity API Checker (from reputable sources).
- YASNAC is legacy (SafetyNet) and no longer authoritative; prefer Play Integrity testers.

### Bricked Device Recovery

Determine brick type:

- Soft brick (recoverable): can reach fastboot/download/recovery; device shows signs of life. High recovery chance.
- Hard brick: no response, no LEDs, not detected by PC. Recovery depends on SoC and tools; professional help may be required.

#### Soft Brick

1. Enter recovery/bootloader (try all key combos; see Emergency).
2. Flash exact stock firmware for your model/region.
   - Pixel: Factory images/Android Flash Tool.
   - Samsung: Odin with full firmware. OEM unlock must be enabled; KNOX 0x1 is permanent once tripped.
   - Xiaomi: Mi Flash Tool (fastboot ROMs). Beware Anti-Rollback. Some operations require authorized Mi accounts.
   - OnePlus: MSMDownloadTool or fastboot ROMs (varies by generation).
3. Factory reset if system is corrupted:
   ```bash
   fastboot -w
   fastboot reboot
   ```

#### Hard Brick

Options vary by SoC/manufacturer:
- Qualcomm EDL (9008): Requires test points or special cable; many devices require authorized accounts to flash.
- OnePlus MSM tools (legacy models): Full unbrick to factory state where available.
- Samsung Smart Switch Emergency Recovery: Limited success, model-dependent.
- Professional services: JTAG/ISP/board-level repair for valuable devices.

Prevention:
- Confirm firmware/build numbers match exactly.
- Keep device charged; don‚Äôt interrupt flash.
- Always back up before flashing.

## Beginner Guide

### What is Rooting?

Rooting grants superuser access (su) so apps and scripts can perform privileged operations. It‚Äôs like admin on a PC.

What you can do:
- Systemless ad blocking, debloat, advanced backups, automation, theming, kernel tuning, firewall, host-based filters.
- Power-user tools: AppOps, file system access, task automation, per-app network controls.
- Advanced frameworks: [LSPosed Framework Guide](./android-root-guides/lsposed-guide.md) for Xposed modules
- Explore apps: [Essential Root Apps](./android-root-apps/index.md#featured-apps-the-essentials) ‚Ä¢ [Backup & Restore Tools](./android-root-apps/index.md#backup-and-restore)

Alternatives without root:
- Shizuku/Sui, ADB-based tweaks, DNS-based ad blocking, work profiles. Great for many tasks without unlocking.
- General guides: [Android Tips & Tricks](./guides/index.md) ‚Ä¢ [Android Ad Blocking](./guides/android-adblocking.md) ‚Ä¢ [App Debloating](./guides/android-apps-debloating.md)

Learn more: [What is Root Access?](./android-root-guides/index.md#understanding-root-access)

### Is Rooting Safe?

- Safe when you follow device-specific, up-to-date guides and use trusted sources.
- Risks:
  - Warranty voiding and irreversible flags (e.g., Samsung KNOX 0x1).
  - Data wipe when unlocking bootloader.
  - App compatibility issues (integrity checks).
  - Potential soft/hard bricks if flashing wrong images.

Safety tips:
- Back up before every major change.
- Verify images against your exact build fingerprint.
- Read your device‚Äôs XDA/Telegram threads before flashing.

### Which Root Method Should I Use?

- Magisk (recommended for most): Widest compatibility, active development, Zygisk, DenyList, robust OTA flow.
- KernelSU: Kernel-integrated su; excellent for custom-kernel ROMs; device/kernel support required.
- APatch: Kernel patching approach for supported devices; best for advanced users/developers.
- Learn about Custom ROMs: [Custom ROM Installation Guide](./android-root-guides/custom-rom-installation.md)

See: [Root Solutions Comparison](./android-root-guides/index.md#root-solutions-comparison)

### Rooting Process Overview

1) Prep
- Confirm bootloader unlock support; charge >50%; back up; enable Developer Options.

2) Unlock bootloader
- Enable OEM unlocking.
- Reboot to bootloader ‚Üí `fastboot flashing unlock`
- Some devices require additional step: `fastboot flashing unlock_critical`
- Unlock wipes data.
- Complete guide: [How to Unlock Bootloader](./android-root-guides/how-to-unlock-bootloader.md)

3) Patch the correct image
- Extract from your exact firmware build:
  - Android 13+ devices (e.g., Pixel 7/8/9): patch init_boot.img.
  - Older devices: patch boot.img.
- Patch with Magisk on-device.

4) Flash
```bash
# A/B example
fastboot flash init_boot_a magisk_patched.img
fastboot flash init_boot_b magisk_patched.img
fastboot reboot
```

5) Verify and set up
- Open Magisk ‚Üí verify installed.
- Configure DenyList if needed.
- Test with a simple root app.

  - Xiaomi: Requires Mi Unlock tool and waiting period; beware Anti-Rollback.
  - Some carrier variants on any brand may be permanently locked.

Custom recovery and fastbootd
- Custom recovery options:
  - TWRP, OrangeFox (availability varies on Android 12+ with dynamic partitions/FBE).
- Installation guide: [Custom Recovery Installation](./android-root-guides/how-to-install-custom-recovery.md)
- Userspace fastboot (fastbootd):
  - `adb reboot fastboot` for dynamic partitions flashing.
- Install/boot examples:
  ```bash
  fastboot boot recovery.img          # test without flashing
  fastboot flash recovery recovery.img
  ```

Guides: 
- [How to Unlock Bootloader](./android-root-guides/how-to-unlock-bootloader.md)

```bash
# Verify Magisk in shell (if su works)
adb shell su -c "magisk --version"

# Re-patch the correct image from your current build
# For Pixels: extract from factory image or OTA payload.bin (payload-dumper-go)
```

OTA survival (A/B devices)
- Install OTA via system updater.
- In Magisk ‚Üí Install ‚Üí ‚ÄúInstall to Inactive Slot (After OTA)‚Äù.
- Reboot when prompted by Magisk, not before.

AVB / vbmeta
- Most Magisk installs do NOT require disabling verity/verification.
- Only disable AVB if your device/ROM/kernel documentation explicitly says so.

Module conflicts
- Use module safe mode (see Emergency).
- Remove problematic module folders under `/data/adb/modules/`.
- Check Magisk logs.

Logs to collect for help
```bash
adb logcat -b all -d > logcat.txt
adb shell dmesg > dmesg.txt
adb shell getprop > props.txt
```

Performance tuning (rooted)
- Battery: tune governors, block wakelocks, disable bloat, use per-app standby.
- Performance: schedutil/interactive governors, zram tuning, I/O schedulers where available.
- Gaming: thermal profiles, GPU policies (device dependent).
- Always test stability and thermals after changes.

Notes and policy
- This guide prioritizes safety, accuracy, and respect for app developers‚Äô security requirements. Some integrity checks (e.g., hardware-backed STRONG integrity) cannot be passed on unlocked devices. Consider a separate non-rooted device for sensitive apps.
- Always consult your device‚Äôs most active development threads for model-specific changes that may supersede the guidance above.
