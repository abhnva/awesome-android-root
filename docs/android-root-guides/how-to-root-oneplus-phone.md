:::

## Why OnePlus Devices Are Ideal for Rooting
- Simple bootloader unlock (no OEM token for most non-carrier variants)
- Active custom ROM/kernel scene (especially 5/6/7/8/9 and Nord lines)
- Seamless A/B updates make root retention predictable via Magisk
- Generally developer-friendly policies and unlockable bootloaders

Notes that changed recently:
- MSM Download Tool (EDL unbrick) is widely available up to ~OnePlus 9 series. For OnePlus 10/11/12 and newer, EDL flashing may require authorized accounts (public MSM packages are often unavailable). Plan recovery accordingly.

## Critical Warnings

> ‚ö†Ô∏è OnePlus-specific considerations
- Unlocking wipes everything (including internal storage and eSIM). Back up first.
- Warranty/after-sales may be affected in your region.
- Some carrier variants are bootloader-locked and/or not unlockable:
  - Verizon OnePlus 8 5G UW and similar ‚ÄúUW‚Äù SKUs: typically not unlockable
  - Some T‚ÄëMobile variants: require SIM unlock first; some older models required an unlock token
- OTAs can fail if partitions are modified beyond boot/init_boot (keep system partitions stock for smooth OTAs).
- ColorOS/OxygenOS unification on newer devices changes recovery/EDL behaviors; TWRP support is sparse on 2022+ models.
- Widevine may drop to L3 on some devices after unlock/root; bank/DRM apps may need extra steps (see Play Integrity section).

## Supported Devices
All OnePlus devices with unlockable bootloaders.

- Flagship: OnePlus 12, 11, 10/10 Pro, 9/9 Pro, 8/8 Pro/8T, 7/7 Pro/7T/7T Pro
- Nord series: Nord 3/2/2T, Nord CE/CE 2/CE 3, Nord N series (varies by region)
- Legacy: OnePlus 6/6T, 5/5T
- Newer flagships (e.g., 13) follow similar principles, but always verify partition layout (boot vs init_boot) and OTA mechanics for your exact build.

> Tip: Carrier/region variants can differ. Always check your exact model (Settings ‚Üí About phone ‚Üí Model/Build).

## Prerequisites & Setup (OnePlus specifics)
- Tools: Platform Tools, Magisk APK, full OTA/firmware, payload dumper (e.g., payload‚Äëdumper‚Äëgo)
- Note: On newer OOS/ColorOS builds, OEM Unlocking toggles may appear only after device contacts servers. See [Prerequisites](./index.md#prerequisites-and-safety).

## Bootloader Unlocking
Use the universal process: [Bootloader Unlocking](./how-to-unlock-bootloader.md#oneplus). On modern devices use fastboot flashing unlock; some carrier variants may be restricted.

## Root Installation Methods

### Method A: Patch boot/init_boot with Magisk (Recommended)

Why this method?
- Works on all modern OnePlus devices
- Keeps system partitions untouched for OTA friendliness
- Safest when combined with fastboot boot + Magisk Direct Install

Step 1 ‚Äî Get the right image
1) Download the full OTA/firmware that exactly matches your current build.
2) Extract payload.bin, then dump:
   - boot.img
   - init_boot.img (if present on your device/build)
   - vendor_boot.img (do not patch/flash for Magisk)
3) Which one to patch?
   - Open Magisk ‚Üí Check ‚ÄúRamdisk‚Äù:
     - Ramdisk = Yes ‚Üí patch boot.img
     - Ramdisk = No ‚Üí patch init_boot.img
   - If uncertain and you see an init_boot partition, patch init_boot.img.

Step 2 ‚Äî Patch with Magisk (see [Magisk Guide](./magisk-guide.md#method-1-boot-image-patching-recommended))
```bash
adb push boot_or_init_boot.img /sdcard/Download/
adb install Magisk-v[version].apk
```
On phone: Magisk ‚Üí Install ‚Üí ‚ÄúSelect and patch a file‚Äù ‚Üí choose the image you pushed.
Pull the patched image back:
```bash
adb pull /sdcard/Download/magisk_patched-*.img ./
```

Step 3 ‚Äî Safer first run: fastboot boot (temporary boot)
```bash
adb reboot bootloader
fastboot boot magisk_patched-*.img
```
- This boots once with Magisk without flashing anything. If it boots fine:
  - Open Magisk ‚Üí Install ‚Üí ‚ÄúDirect Install (Recommended)‚Äù to patch the active slot permanently ‚Üí Reboot.

If fastboot boot is not supported on your device:
- Flash the correct partition directly (use the one you patched: boot OR init_boot):
```bash
fastboot getvar current-slot
# Suppose current-slot is a
fastboot flash boot magisk_patched-*.img        # if you patched boot.img
# or
fastboot flash init_boot magisk_patched-*.img   # if you patched init_boot.img
fastboot reboot
```

> Important:
> - Do NOT flash/disable vbmeta with ‚Äú--disable-verity/verification‚Äù for Magisk. Magisk works with AVB; disabling AVB is unnecessary and risky.
> - A/B slots: You only need to patch the active slot. For OTAs, use Magisk‚Äôs ‚ÄúInstall to Inactive Slot (After OTA).‚Äù

### Method B: Custom Recovery (limited on 2022+ devices)
- Modern OnePlus devices (10/11/12 and many Nord CE/N) often lack stable TWRP with FBE v2 decryption due to dynamic/virtual A/B and ColorOS changes.
- If your device has a maintained TWRP/OrangeFox:
  - Prefer fastboot boot recovery.img (temporary) over flashing a non-existent recovery partition.
  - Then Install ‚Üí flash the Magisk APK renamed to .zip (Magisk-vXX.apk ‚Üí Magisk-vXX.zip).
  - Reboot system ‚Üí open Magisk to finalize.

> If your device does not have a stable custom recovery, stick to Method A.

## OnePlus-Specific Troubleshooting

### Unbrick/EDL
- MSM Download Tool is commonly available up to OnePlus 9 series. For 10/11/12 and newer, EDL flashing typically requires an authorized account (public MSM packages may be unavailable).
- If you hard brick on newer models without MSM access, your best options are:
  - Working fastboot/fastbootd to flash stock images
  - Service center assistance
  - Community EDL services (ensure trustworthiness)

Enter EDL (varies): Power off ‚Üí hold both Volume keys while connecting USB (device shows as Qualcomm HS-USB QDLoader 9008 in Device Manager).

### Bootloops after modules
- Disable all Magisk modules without wiping:
  - If you can get ADB after boot completes:
    ```bash
    adb shell su -c "magisk --remove-modules"
    ```
  - Or from recovery/adb shell, delete module folders:
    /data/adb/modules/*
- As a last resort, fastboot boot a stock boot/init_boot to get into system, then fix modules and re-root properly.

### OTA update strategy on rooted devices
- Best practice (A/B seamless):
  1) System Settings ‚Üí Download OTA (do NOT reboot yet)
  2) Open Magisk ‚Üí Install ‚Üí ‚ÄúInstall to Inactive Slot (After OTA)‚Äù
  3) Return to System Updater ‚Üí Reboot
- If you took the OTA already and lost root:
  - Extract the new build‚Äôs boot/init_boot, patch with Magisk, and flash/boot as before.
- If OTA fails:
  - Use a full OTA instead of incremental, keep partitions stock (don‚Äôt modify system/vendor), and avoid custom recoveries for OTAs on modern devices.

### OxygenOS vs ColorOS (unified base)
- On OnePlus 10/11/12 and most new Nord devices, OOS is ColorOS-based under the hood.
- Root steps remain the same (boot vs init_boot decision is the key).
- Local update UI may be hidden; use the ‚ÄúOPLocalUpdate‚Äù APK for sideloading full OTA zips when needed.

## Performance & Modules

Recommended Magisk setup on OnePlus:
- Enable Zygisk in Magisk settings
- Configure DenyList for sensitive apps
- Play Integrity fix: Use a maintained module for BASIC/DEVICE integrity (e.g., ‚ÄúPlay Integrity Fix‚Äù ‚Äî community maintained; project names/forks change over time)
- LSPosed (Zygisk) for module ecosystem
- Optional privacy/root-hiding layer like Shamiko (where legal/allowed; requires Zygisk and DenyList not in enforcement mode)

Custom kernels (device-dependent):
- Gains: power efficiency, sched/tuning, sometimes GPU/perf or sound features
- Ensure kernel is built for your exact build and supports Magisk/KernelSU if you use them

> Note: Passing Google Play Integrity on rooted devices is an arms race; results may vary by region, app, and time.

## Alternative Root Methods

### Method C: Direct partition backup (advanced)
Useful to save a clean copy before you start:
```bash
# After first root or from recovery shell
adb shell su -c "dd if=/dev/block/bootdevice/by-name/boot_a of=/sdcard/boot_a.img"
adb shell su -c "dd if=/dev/block/bootdevice/by-name/boot_b of=/sdcard/boot_b.img"
# If present:
adb shell su -c "dd if=/dev/block/bootdevice/by-name/init_boot_a of=/sdcard/init_boot_a.img"
adb shell su -c "dd if=/dev/block/bootdevice/by-name/init_boot_b of=/sdcard/init_boot_b.img"
```

### Method D: Custom recovery first (older devices)
- On 5/5T/6/6T/7/7T/8/9 (varies by maintainer), you can install TWRP then flash Magisk.
- On dynamic/virtual A/B devices, prefer ‚Äúfastboot boot twrp.img‚Äù and install from within TWRP instead of flashing recovery to a non-existent partition.

## Success Verification

- Open Magisk ‚Üí should show ‚ÄúInstalled‚Äù with version
- ADB root check:
```bash
adb shell su -c "id"
# uid=0(root) gid=0(root) ...
```
- Play Integrity/SafetyNet:
  - Use a Play Integrity checker app; with proper configuration, BASIC and sometimes DEVICE integrity can pass.
  - Configure DenyList for banking/wallet/DRM apps.

## Staying Updated

- Wait for community confirmations before major OTAs (esp. Android version jumps).
- Prefer full OTAs and the Magisk ‚ÄúInstall to Inactive Slot (After OTA)‚Äù workflow.
- Custom ROMs (LineageOS/etc.) can provide newer Android versions sooner, but recovery/root procedures change‚Äîfollow each ROM‚Äôs specific instructions.

::: tip üí° OnePlus Root Success Tips
- Prefer ‚Äúfastboot boot‚Äù the patched image first; then use Magisk‚Äôs Direct Install. It‚Äôs safer than flashing right away.
- Do not disable AVB (vbmeta) for Magisk; it‚Äôs unnecessary and can cause issues.
- Keep a copy of your stock boot/init_boot matching your current build.
- MSM/EDL unbrick is not guaranteed on newer models; avoid risky flashes.
- Use the exact firmware build for your device and region. Mismatches cause boot loops.
